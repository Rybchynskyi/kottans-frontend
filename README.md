My first expression about Git:
Actually, i think that git is the most important think in teamwork. It`s like time-mashine ‚è±, that can move you in past statement of the project.

I can`t imaging how developers worked before git was deweloped üòµ‚Äçüí´

The most important think that I understand, is that you can make many branches. And in each branch you can code new features for the main project.

I thtink that I will use not all commands that I learned. But i must understand this commands for sure.
Because if you dont understand philosofy of git - yoy can make many mistakes in deployment.

Espetialy thanks for the selection of learning materials.
Because today we have many courses about deployment in internet. But not all of them are useful and understandable.
Great and importand job üëç

Let`s continue. Good luck everyone

##Task ‚Ññ1: I can't imagine how people worked before they —Åreated the first visual shell. It was terrible. And procesess was ten times slower. Therefore, the burden on a modern programmer is very large (when compared with the past).
I saw a lot of commands that will make it easier to work with GIT and set up a web server. In some cases - linux commands can be better than macOS commands. the "man" command is especially useful, which will help you solve any problem in Linux

##Task ‚Ññ2: I taught backend. Thats why a lot of the basics were not new to me. I repeated the messages of the answers and learned a few new ones. Headings are overly detailed. In general, I think that the article is very difficult for beginners.

##Task ‚Ññ3: There was a lot of new unteresting material here. It was especially interesting to learn about hash and cache memory. I did not know that it is on proxy servers too. I thought that cache memory can exist only in user's PC )
