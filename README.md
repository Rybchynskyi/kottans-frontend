It's my repo repository for kottans

My first expression about Git:
Actually, I think that git is the most important thing in teamwork. It's like a time-machine ‚è±, that can move you in past statement of the project.

I can't imagine how developers worked before git was developed üòµ‚Äçüí´

The most important thing that I understood, is that you can make many branches. And in each branch you can code new features for the main project.

I think that I will use not all commands which I learned. But I must understand these commands for sure.
Because if you don't understand philosophy of git - you will make many mistakes in deployment.

Especially thanks for the selection of learning materials.
Because today we have many courses about deployment in internet. But not all of them are useful and understandable.
Great and important job üëç

Let's continue. Good luck everyone

### Task ‚Ññ1:
I can't imagine how people worked before they created the first visual shell. It was terrible. And processes were ten times slower. Therefore, the burden on a modern programmer is very large (compared with the past).
I saw a lot of commands that could make it easier to work with GIT and set up a web server. In some cases, Linux commands can be better than macOS commands. The "man" command is especially useful, which will help you to solve any problems in Linux shell

### Task ‚Ññ2:
I studied backend. That's why a lot of the basics were not new to me. I repeated the messages of the answers and learned a few new ones. Headings are overly detailed. In general, I think that the article is very difficult for beginners.

### Task ‚Ññ3:
There was a lot of new interesting material here. It was especially interesting to learn about hash and cache memory. I did not know that it is on proxy servers too. I thought that cache memory can exist only in user's PC )

### Task ‚Ññ1: Introduction to Git and GitHub (weeks 3 and 4):
Forks is a really interesting thing. Because you can improve other projects, or you can ask for help to others.
Issues help with productive work.

### Task ‚Ññ2: learngitbranching.js.org:
- Cherry-pick - copy other commits to HEAD
- Rebase - warning: it makes a straight line  from commits and rewrite them. Better to use just in my separated branch
Other useful commands:

My thoughts on the passed material:
A very useful topic cinematic positions. I didn't know about these rules and how they affect in Google search.

css - a lot of new material. Box-sizing (border-box - very convenient), floating elements and positions - were the most difficult parts of the css for me. I have teached additional material on this topic an i have to practice it.

Some of usefull pictures:

Flexbox is a awesome technology!  With the media requests together - it solves all issues of adaptive design.
The approach is logical and simple. I need to try it in practice.

Grid is even better than Flexbox. However, for me it seems more difficult in practice. I look forward to the next practical task. I will try to solve it using Grid technology.

In the future, I plan to always work with Grid technologies. First mark up the page, and then fill it with content.
