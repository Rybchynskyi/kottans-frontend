Hello everyone 👋
I`m Alex: https://github.com/Rybchynskyi/

Its my repo repository for kottans

My first expression about Git:
Actually, i think that git is the most important think in teamwork. It`s like time-mashine ⏱, that can move you in past statement of the project.

I can`t imaging how developers worked before git was deweloped 😵‍💫

The most important think that I understand, is that you can make many branches. And in each branch you can code new features for the main project.

I thtink that I will use not all commands that I learned. But i must understand this commands for sure.
Because if you dont understand philosofy of git - yoy can make many mistakes in deployment.

Espetialy thanks for the selection of learning materials.
Because today we have many courses about deployment in internet. But not all of them are useful and understandable.
Great and importand job 👍

Let`s continue
